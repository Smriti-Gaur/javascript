// API stands for Application Programming Interface.
// It's essentially a set of rules and specifications 
//that software programs can follow to communicate with each other.
//  Think of it as a contract that defines how different software 
//components can interact and exchange data. 

// Imagine you're ordering food at a restaurant.
// You (the customer) interact with the waiter (the API). 
// You place your order (the request), and the waiter (the API) communicates your order to the kitchen (the server).
// The kitchen prepares the food (processes the request) and sends it back to the waiter,
// who then delivers it to you (the response).
